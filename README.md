# workstation
Install (almost) everything I need to start being productive on an Ubuntu flavored OS.


## Assumptions

I have a brand-new Ubuntu flavored OS, with absolute stock defaults.


## How to use it

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   apt-get install -yq git
   mkdir -pv "$HOME/repos/github.com/dale-c-anderson"
   cd "$HOME/repos/github.com/dale-c-anderson"
   git clone https://github.com/dale-c-anderson/workstation
   cd workstation
   ```

2. Have a look inside `recipes/` folder, and examine each one's `group_vars/all.yml` file. If one of them suits your needs, proceed to step 3. Otherwise, duplicate or modify one of the dirs as needed.

3. Run the bootstrap script, specifying the name of the recipe to use:
   ```bash
   ./bootstrap Ubuntu_18.04   # for example.
   ```
   * The bootstrap script installs ansible, installs role dependencies, and runs `ansible-playbook` for the recipe you chose.
